Many adjustment to quasimorphosis gain/loss features for personal use. Uploaded to workshop to not lose it.

**Need to restart the game after MCM config setup for this mod to take effect**

Lots of various adjustable values at default set to my personal liking. However you should be able to adjust them on MCM menu - if you adjust it ehough, you can even revert it to vanilla value!

Reasoning on default values:
It is my personal opinion that humans on lategame are more powerful than the quasimorphs.
Naturally, it becomes logical to simply eat human meat to proc rapture to fight easier enemies on lategame. who wouldn't want to be in a defensive position fighting melee enemy that congaline to your position?
In this point of view, quasimorphosis is a reward point to make game easier. So you should not be able to get it so easily or maintain it easily.

**Therefore by default you passively lose quasimorphosis.** To encourage non-passive behavior, human quasimorphosis gain increased by +100%. Reduced consumable quasimorphosis gain by -80%. Reduced quasimorph quasimorphosis gain by -40% since they were too high and made rapture-spiral too sharp to recover from. (all of those values are configurable on MCM)

...and many others to make sure player can keep the pace of the murder and mayham. Not the game.
Like the fact that at 400-500 quasimorphosis on 60 men floor (which should be standard for lategame 0.9.8) will simply spiral down to rapture. Or having +5 quasimorphosis gain passively from implants. All of it, throttled so the player's murder is the main driving factor of quasimorphosis, not the game spiralling out of control so you fight quasi and quasi only. I want to fight human enemies while enjoying chaos of quasimorphosis.


Gavakh in particular kept the usual quasimorphosis gain upon usage, which I thought was fitting and it was rare enough to deserve this kind of treatment.

Change Log:

v1.12:
Revert endless hunt logic because quasi spawned during the +800 quasimorphosis didn't hunt for you.

v1.11:
Optimize manual endless hunt trigger logic.

v1.1:
Crash caused by prefix with experimental function. Reverted to more stable prefix - postfix conbination.
